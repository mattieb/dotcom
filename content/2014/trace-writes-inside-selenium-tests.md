My current project at [Atomic Object](https://atomicobject.com/)
uses [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) to drive browsers for
integration testingâ€”and it turns out that it's a useful debugging
tool, too. I've written on [how to do trace
writes](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/12/28/trace-writes-inside-selenium-tests/)
in that framework over at [Atomic Spin](http://spin.atomicobject.com/).
