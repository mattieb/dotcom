My scheduled [talk on octothorpe](/2014/octothorpe-talk-slides-pyohio.html)
wasn't the only thing I presented.  Ben Rousch planted the seed in
my mind that I should put my name up on the lightning talk board
to introduce brewdo.

Here are [those slides](brewdo-pyohio.pdf).  Excelsior!

(And now I'm done doing PyOhio 2014 talks.)
