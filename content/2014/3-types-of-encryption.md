For my second post at [Atomic Spin](http://spin.atomicobject.com/),
I've chosen to write about [Understanding the 3 main types of
encryption](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/11/20/encryption-symmetric-asymmetric-hashing/)â€”symmetric,
asymmetric, and hashing. This spawned from an office discussion
about encryption topics, and I thought a tour of how developers
could best use the three would make a good post.
