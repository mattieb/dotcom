My blog seems to be for posting talk slides lately.  In that grand
tradition, here are [the slides from my octothorpe
talk](octothorpe-talk.pdf) that I gave at [GRDevDay](http://grdevday.org/)
2014.  The examples are all avaliable in [the repository at
GitHub](https://github.com/zigg/octothorpe).

Thanks to all who came; I hope you enjoyed this talk.  I'll be revisiting
it next month at [GRPUG](http://www.meetup.com/grpython/), likely with
a little more in-depth material.
