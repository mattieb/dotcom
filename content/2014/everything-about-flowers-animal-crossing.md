Ah, [Animal Crossing][1].  Sinker of time.  I've played every iteration
of the series since [its debut on GameCube][2].  The second one, [Wild
World][3] on the [Nintendo DS][4], I probably played the most, due in
no small part to one mechanic I found ridiculously addictive: making
rare hybrid flowers.

In Animal Crossing games, you can buy flower seeds from the in-game
shops; planting these instantly spawns flowers.  But since Wild World
(at least… I'm not really sure how the original worked!), you've only
been able to buy the flowers in boring colors.  If you wanted to enjoy
wonderful new colors of flowers, you had to engage in hybridization.

For Wild World, I relied heavily on the venerable [Animal Crossing
Ahead][5] [hybrid guide][6].  A quick summary of how this worked:
every morning at 6 a.m. (real time, per the Animal Crossing tradition),
a handful of new flowers would spawn in random spots in your village.
By default, these would be the boring-colored flowers.  But if they
happened to be touching a flower that in turn was touching another and
the latter two a pair that could produce a hybrid color—basically, if
all the stars were aligned in your favor—you could get yourself a
beautiful new hybrid-colored flower.  The super-rare blue roses,
the crown jewel of cross-breeding, could only be produced by a black
and a purple rose, themselves hybrids.  And so, for months, in
addition to playing with the game's other systems, I set out to
collect 'em all, if you will.

[City Folk][7] on [Wii][8] was effectively the same as Wild World (and,
frankly, not something I played all that much because why would I run
my own virtual town on the family TV?), but for the latest installation,
[New Leaf][9], Nintendo mixed things up quite a bit.  What *exactly*
they did took some digging—the random systems are notorious for
making people think they understand how things work when in reality
the dice were just rolling in their favor, leaving several guides
to give information that was just plain wrong—but here's what I've
got.

## Gene theory

There's a confusing tendency amongst parent flowers in New Leaf to
reproduce in apparently strange fashions.  You'll definitely see this
when you're trying to achieve the big prize—blue roses—as your parent
candidates will spawn just about everything but blue, including flowers
you think should be impossible.

I believe, after reviewing FAQs and having grown every non-carnation
flower by myself, that this is due to child flowers retaining genetic
information from their ancestors.  Some FAQs say "any flower can spawn
as a hybrid, or as one of its parents," then try to explain weird
pairings by listing them as legitimate hybrids.  I don't think those
weird pairings are at all canonical hybrids, but rather the genes of
ancestors coming back and making their own hybrid spawns.  I don't
believe I'd ever seen a "weird" spawn that could not be explained in
this fashion.

Gene theory also explains the insanity of the purple pansies and blue
roses.  Both spawn from flowers that look ordinary, but in fact have
ancestries including many of the possible flowers of that species.
Additionally, both take a lot of rolling of the CPU's dice before
they actually spawn, which suggests to me that ancestral genes are
randomly assigned weights and those weights must land in particular
alignment before the prize flowers are actually grown.

But (and this is my pro tip) once the genes are aligned well enough to
produce a particular hybrid twice, it becomes much easier to spawn
additional hybrids simply by crossing the two with each other.  Blue
roses are notorious for this—if you use one of my later tips to 
concentrate your spawns, blue roses have a good chance of overtaking
your town entirely!  The garden around my house is periodically
threatening to do this…

With that in mind, here are what I believe are the canonical crosses.

## Canonical crosses

### Carnations

Carnations are particularly tricky because you'll only be able to get
them on holidays—a pink carnation on Mother's Day and a red on Father's
Day.  Their crossings are pretty straightforward:

* red × pink ⇒ white

### Cosmos

Cosmos come in two generations.  Orange and pink cosmos can be obtained
via pairings of basic flowers.  I found the second-generation black
cosmos, which spawn from a pair of otherwise-plentiful orange cosmos,
very hard to grow.

* red × yellow ⇒ orange
* red × white ⇒ pink
* orange × orange ⇒ black

### Lilies

Lilies only come in one generation.  I also had a hard time buying red
lilies—I ended up stealing them from Tortimer's island minigames.

* red × red ⇒ black
* red × yellow ⇒ orange
* red × white ⇒ pink

### Pansies

Pansies are one of the two three-generation species.  Expect to be working
at the third generation for weeks or months.

Note the "red*" notation here.  I'm using this to indicate a red pansy
with the genes necessary to spawn a purple.  It won't look any differently
in-game, however!

* red × yelllow ⇒ orange
* white × white ⇒ blue
* red × blue ⇒ red*
* red* × red* ⇒ purple

### Tulips

Tulips are another two-generation species.  For some reason, I had
a very hard time growing purple tulips, but a friend who wasn't
even trying got them before me.

* red × red ⇒ black
* red × yellow ⇒ orange
* red × white ⇒ pink
* orange × orange ⇒ purple

### Roses

Roses are, once again, the most complex species.  They are a
three-generation species, but they *also* have a special non-generational
transformation wherein a black rose will turn gold (and no longer need
watering) if you allow it to wilt and water it with the gold watering can.

Again, I'm using "red*" to notate a red rose with the genes necessary
for the ultimate prize.

* red × red ⇒ black
* red × yellow ⇒ orange
* red × white ⇒ pink
* white × white ⇒ purple
* orange × purple ⇒ red*
* red* × red* ⇒ blue

### Violets

The final species is the violet.  These are very simple, with only
a single hybridization available—though it took me some time to
achieve.

* white × white ⇒ blue

## Influencing spawning

Now that you know what flowers you need to cross, how do you get them
to make sweet flower love?  I believe spawning works a little differently
in New Leaf.  Rather than randomly spawning anywhere in town, new
flowers in New Leaf spawn from randomly-chosen existing flowers and their
nearby co-parents.

The key advantage of knowing this fact is that if you *really* want to
throw all your effort behind crossing two parents, the best thing you
can do is *rip up all the other flowers in town*.  This greatly amplifies
the chance that your candidate pair will be chosen right up to "absolute
certainty."  Of course, you still have the die rolls happening with
genetic weighting, but if you're shooting for blue roses, this is where
you want to go.  You can store flowers you don't want to destroy in your
house; they won't ever wilt there.  (My basement is "Flora's Ark…")

Beyond this, watering is important, but I have come to believe that
*sunshine* is as well.  While it's true that a manually-watered flower
keeps it from wilting the next day, and a rainy (or snowy) day keeps
all flowers from wilting, I've come to believe that *if there are never
even partly clear skies*, hybridization chances are greatly reduced…
*even if you manually water*.  I had a particularly painful few weeks
early in my flower odyssey where it was constantly raining heavily
whenever I went to play, and my spawns really appeared to suffer.  Bad
news, those cloudy skies.

If you do have sun, though, selective watering is also useful.
You can, of course, water everything in town, but if you only water
the flowers you're interested in getting spawns from plus those that are
wilted (lest they disappear entirely), you'll find the selectively-watered
flowers will spawn more often.

Finally, if you're far enough in the game to have fertilizer,
planting this so it touches parents will effectively guarantee a
spawn the next day.  I use fertilizer mainly to bulk up my quantities
of rare flowers, since it wasn't available until I had already grown
pairs of everything.  I imagine, though, that if you get it before
you have all the hybrids you want, you can use it to help you along.

## Flower sex on the beach

One more tip: if you haven't noticed yet, you may someday come
across one of your adorable little villagers looking at your plots of
rare roses, stopping and looking constipated for a moment, and then
dropping a boring old basic flower amongst them.  These are only a mild
pain sometimes, but if you're trying to grow specifically-gened roses
or pansies, it can make you lose track of which flowers were actually
the important ones.  (Yes, this happened to me!)

To solve this—or, at least, make a darn good try at solving it—plant
your special pairs on the beach, with plenty of space between them so
you don't risk them cross-contaminating.  I have never had a villager
plant a flower on the beach (though, to come totally clean with you,
I have heard people claim they had it happen… I'm not totally convinced
it wasn't just an ancrestral spawn, though.)  I believe that judicious
use of the beach for generation of red* pansies and red* roses as well
as their eventual rare children helped keep me from going totally
insane with my flower husbandry.

## That's all!  I think…

And that's about all I've got.  I hope I didn't miss anything.
Thanks a ton to [the New Leaf crew on GAF][10], particularly my
early co-conspirator (and supplier of much raw floral material)
[Philia][11].

Good luck with those flowers!
