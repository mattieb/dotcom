[Turning asynchronous networking
inside-out](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/10/06/turning-asynchronous-networking-inside/)
is my very first [Atomic Spin](http://spin.atomicobject.com/) post
here at [Atomic Object](https://atomicobject.com/). It walks through
why asynchronous networking is so important, and then shows the key
differences between callback-driven asynchronous code using
[Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/) code and the new coroutine-based
hotness of [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
