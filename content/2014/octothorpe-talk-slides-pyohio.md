----

The slide deck is refreshed a bit, so here are [my octothorpe talk
slides](octothorpe-pyohio.pdf) from [PyOhio 2014](http://pyohio.org).

This is probably the last iteration of this talk I'll give, so I hope
everyone enjoyed it!

**UPDATE:** [Video from this
talk](http://pyvideo.org/video/2857/making-and-taking-phone-calls-with-octothorpe)
is now available at (pyvideo.org)[http://pyvideo.org/].
