# About me

----

Hi there. I'm Mattie Behrens, a.k.a. zigg.

I'm a software developer and consultant at [Atomic Object](https://atomicobject.com/), where I've worked on a wide range of software projects that have run the gamut of languages, platforms, and purposes.

I'm queer (out since September 2017), married, and a parent living a life loving reading (especially biographies and queer history), Nintendo games, and movies. And learning a little bit every day what life means.

I've got a number of presences online, but I'm mostly hanging out at Queer Garden these days, at [@zigg@queer.garden](https://queer.garden/@zigg). You can also email me at mattie at zigg dot com.
