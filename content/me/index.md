# About me

----

Hi there. I'm Matt Behrens, a.k.a. zigg.

I'm a software developer/engineer and devoted Unix fan. It all
started in the early 90's when I found myself spending a lot of
extracurricular time in the Unix lab at school. I brought Unix(-alikes)
into my home, first with the venerable [Slackware][1], then moving
to [FreeBSD][2] and [OpenBSD][3]. Since then, I've moved back and
forth between OpenBSD and Linux for my home server, and spent a lot
of time using various flavors of Linux on the desktop before finally
deciding that while I still loved Unix, my time was worth more than
the endless fiddling I needed to keep it goingâ€”and thus I moved to [OS
X][4]. Now I'm a certifiable Apple nerd, and this server runs OpenBSD
on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/).

Professionally, I do a lot with Unix and Linux. I've worked a lot
with [Solaris][5] and [CentOS][6], engineering and developing
applications for [Zope][7], [Oracle Applications][8], [Asterisk][9],
and many other systems. I spent a lot of time working largely in
[Python][10], though I've also worked extensively in Unix, [Java][11],
[Perl][12], [PHP][13], and lately (like everyone else in the world)
a lot of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
(via [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), if I can.)

I'm all over the Web, as most are. Here is a smattering of places
you can find me:

* [@zigg][14] on [Twitter][15]
* [zigg][16] on [Github][17]
* [zigg][18] on [Stack Overflow][19] (and [associated sites][20])
* On [LinkedIn][21]

The best way to contact me is through email to matt@zigg.com. My
