----

It's been a long time since I've written a post just for this site, hasn't it?

Nearly three years ago, I
[joined](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/10/17/new-employees-ann-arbor-detroit/)
[Atomic Object](https://atomicobject.com/). (I actually started in
August 2014. We tend to publish our welcome posts a little while after
new Atoms settle in. Also, holy cow. Look at me then and
[now](https://mastodon.social/@zigg/7206664). I guess I _have_ lost
a lot of weight!)

At the time, I was pretty actively blogging here and exploring my
role in the tech community, sharing projects on [my
GitHub](https://github.com/zigg/) both actively-used and experimental,
and even trying out [giving
talks](http://pyvideo.org/pyohio-2014/making-and-taking-phone-calls-with-octothorpe.html).
In retrospect, I was doing a _lot_. And it took a lot of time in
addition to my now much-more-engaging work as an Atom, which is
probably why my GitHub contribution graph seems to have dropped off
since that August.

And so I come now to some housekeeping I've been doing today. One
key piece of that housekeeping was deciding what to do with
[brewdo](https://www.zigg.com/code/brewdo/).

You can read up on [why I originally made
brewdo](https://www.zigg.com/2014/sandboxing-homebrew.html) here
on the blog. Since then, Homebrew has added [their own
sandbox](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/sandbox.rb),
which addressed the most important thing that brewdo does that I
care about. I've been running Homebrew in `$HOME/Library/Homebrew`
with that support in play for some time, and I've been really happy with
it.

So I think now is the time to mark brewdo as unmaintained. I get
bug reports on it every so often, mostly having to do with migration
or installation, problems that take [a lot of
effort](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/11/17/vagrant-osx/) to
even work on. And I just don't have the personal energy for it. I
want to make room in my life for other things.

I'll be doing that shortly. If someone wants to take over brewdo,
I'd be thrilled to pass it on to them! Just get in touch.
