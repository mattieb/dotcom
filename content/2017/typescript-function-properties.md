# Representing function properties in TypeScript

My latest project has made extensive use of
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), which makes JavaScript
_significantly_ less painful to use. I talk about one discovery I
made on [how to type a
function](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2017/04/11/typescript-represent-function-properties/)
that has an arbitrary property attached to it over at [Atomic
Spin](https://spin.atomicobject.com).
