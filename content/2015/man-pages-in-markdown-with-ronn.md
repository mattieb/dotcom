[Man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) are great (and I'd argue overlooked a lot these days) but have traditionally been a bit old-school to make. [Ronn](http://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/) makes it possible to easily write man pages with modern [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)â€”and I've written about [how to make man pages in Markdown with Ronn](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/05/06/man-pages-in-markdown-ronn/) over at [Atomic Spin](http://spin.atomicobject.com/).
