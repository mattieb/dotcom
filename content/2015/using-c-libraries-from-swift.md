For a side project I've been working on, I needed to pull in the
[CommonCrypto](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/Common%20Crypto.3cc.html)
C library. Since I've been working in
[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), this wasn't totally
straightforward. I wrote about [getting started using C libraries
from Swift](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/02/23/c-libraries-swift/)
over at [Atomic Spin](http://spin.atomicobject.com/).
