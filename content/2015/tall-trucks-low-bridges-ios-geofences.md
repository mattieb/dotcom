I've been working a bit with geofencing on a project at [Atomic Object](https://atomicobject.com/). The topic turns out to be pretty interesting. Using a recent truck crash into a low bridge as inspiration, I wrote ["Tall trucks, low bridges, and iOS geofencing"](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/07/16/geofencing-ios-objectivec/) for [Atomic Spin](http://spin.atomicobject.com/).
