I gave a lightning talk last night here at [PyOhio](http://pyohio.org)
introducing [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) and a brief
overview of the unique kinds of problems that my old standard of
project isolation—a [Homebrewed](http://brew.sh/) Python and
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)—yielded.

About 16 hours later, I've actually got around to unstuffing my
[liquidluck](http://liquidluck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) virtualenv
by converting it to pyenv. As a result, I can now share the slides
with you!

[Here are those slides](taming-pythons-with-pyenv.pdf) in PDF form.
Thanks, PyOhio!  (And thanks, too,
[Danielle](https://twitter.com/quephird), for letting me use your
pictures of van Rossum!)
