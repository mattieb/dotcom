# xon

----

xon is a Python implementation of something I've come to call "XML
Object Notation", or XON.  It was created to easily support XML in
web-based APIs that already support JSON that I develop as part of
my work at [Code Blue][1].

xon is developed [at GitHub][2] and is available [from PyPI][3].
