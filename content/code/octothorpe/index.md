# octothorpe

----

octothorpe is an [Asterisk Manager Interface][1] library for the
[Twisted][2] engine.  Its goal is to allow easy control of [Asterisk][3]
from a Twisted application.  I feel Twisted's event-driven nature
is a very good match for controlling Asterisk in this fashion.  I
develop octothorpe as part of my work at [Code Blue][4] on telephony
applications.

octothorpe is developed [at GitHub][5].
