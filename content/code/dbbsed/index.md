# Band Brothers Save Tool

----

The Band Brothers Save Tool (formerly the Daigasso! Band Brothers
Save Editor, a mouthful) is a little GUI tool written in [Python][1]
with [wxGlade][2] that allows the manipulation of save dumps from
import cult hit [Daigasso! Band Brothers][3] for [Nintendo DS][4],
premitting us to share our musical creations from the song's in-game
music editor online.

The project is [on SourceForge][5].  You can read [the manual][6]
directly from CVS.
