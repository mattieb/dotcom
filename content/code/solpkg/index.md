# Solaris Package System

----

The Solaris Package System was created to address the fact that the most
popular way to obtain open-source software built for Solaris in 2002,
[Sunfreeware](http://sunfreeware.com), provided binaries and the original
open source code, but not the build infrastructure required to tweak the
binaries slightly.

It was modeled after the [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org) [ports
system](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/ports.html), using Solaris make
to build and create Solaris packages.

Its last release was in 2002.

Code for the Solaris Package system is available [at
Github](https://github.com/zigg/solpkg).
