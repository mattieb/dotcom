# The new lock-in

Much ado is currently being made of Google’s recent announcement
that it will soon join the ranks of contemporary “social” companies
and grant itself [the right to construct ads][1] using your profile
and endorsement. Mercifully, Big Data in this case is letting you
opt out. But what if that’s not enough for you? What if this action
served as your personal revelation that companies like Google and
Facebook have access to a lot of your life, and you have finally
decided you want out?

Well, it’s not so easy as that. As humanity has ridden the course
of increasing cloud-ization of our lives, we have found ourselves
with the intoxicating ability to be able to use our favorite
technologies anywhere and, more recently, with our social circles
readily accessible at any time. The unfortunate, and rarely-considered
effect of all this is that to cut yourself off from a company whose
practices you consider distasteful is to cut yourself off from other
people who are not leaving, be they associates, friends, or even
family. This is the new lock-in.

The Internet was not always like that. In fact, it was once a refuge
from the software companies of yesteryear and their insistence on
proprietary formats and protocols for data interchange, undocumented
and used as a weapon against competition. Email was not new when
the Internet became popular, but email that freely allowed exchange
between sites running different vendors’ software was. Information
exchange was not new when the Internet became popular, but a world
where anyone could start up an information service and the rest of
the world already had the software tools it needed to use it was a
dramatic shift.

As the Internet became more popular, however, companies born of
this heady time became the new conquerors. They played lip service
to the notion of openness, making sure to maintain the parts of the
status quo that still served them, but building massive empires
atop the once-open network with their own brand of lock-in. Even
their “open” API offerings are constructed to channel smaller groups
into hitching their bandwagon to the behemoth rather than allowing
anyone to break free. Breaking free, after all, hurts their bottom
line.

Social features are the modern key driver of this lock-in, with no
consideration given to actual openness at all, but rather very
public embrace of the fact that your social graph, endorsements,
private messaging, commentary, and even creative output are
specifically for the network you create them on. You will never
take it anywhere else without extraordinary measures (and even then,
you may be blocked in the name of Security—though not as much yours
as theirs.) You are locked in.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Developers working in the public
interest could sweep these behemoths aside and build our own
distributed replacements that keep massive organizations’ ownership
dreams at bay. But, more than just code, we need massive momentum
to do so, momentum that will doubtless be difficult to achieve when
everyone is already locked in. Even if they have a strong enough
grievance to prompt them to leave, there are others waiting with
open arms and soothing promises of how easy it will be to join them
instead. That momentum will likely prove to be very, very hard to
get.
