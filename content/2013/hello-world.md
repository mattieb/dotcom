This is my first post on the new zigg.com powered by [Felix
Felicis][1].

How I got here is a bit of a story.  I once was a rather prolific
writer (though of questionable quality) on places like [N-Sider][2]
and my own [Blogger][3]-powered journal.  In those days, Blogger
provided the option to publish directly to my own hosted space
instead of using their servers.  Alas, they claimed it was all very
unreliable (even when using SFTP, which to this day I'm not *totally*
sure I believe) and shut it down unless you wanted to use their
hosting.  So I left what I had and closed up shop.

But the urge to write never really went away; it was just sort of
buried.  In the meantime, more and more people embraced writing in
the cloud, be it crampedly on [Twitter][4] or in style at the lovely
[Medium][5].  [I still tweet][6], but despite [a few experimental
pieces][7] at Medium (and even after experiencing their really nice
feedback system), I remained uncomfortable with this whole notion
that I didn't own the space my words lived in.  These feelings
really got fired up when I was looking at republishing "Permanence"
there; rereading it made me question what the heck I was doing.
Felt like a hypocrite.

Finally, I wanted to post things that weren't quite so… heavy.
Medium didn't feel like the appropriate place to expound on a neat
thing I did in [Ansible][8] the other day.  So I opted to check out
static site generators, found Felix Felicis, found it nice and simple
and pretty close to what I was looking for, and [Skeleton][10] helped
me save my CSS sanity (to a point).  I still have to stifle
the urge to throw it all away and build my own—something I swore I'd
do for years—but I think it'll do nicely.  Time will tell, and in
the meantime, everything's all nice and [Marked-down][9] so if I ever
do get that burst of energy and redo it all, I won't have to worry
overmuch about content migration.

So, now I have a place to write again.  I'm excited!  I'm very much
looking forward to letting everyone back into the weird world of
me again.  I'm planning on migrating old content as time permits.
Thanks for reading, and thanks for waiting.

(oh who am I kidding nobody was *actually* waiting for me)
