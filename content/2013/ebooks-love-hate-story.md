# eBooks: a love-hate story

A Christmas tradition is developing in my house. It goes a little
something like this:

1. Some gadget is announced in the run-up to the holiday season.

2. I become obsessed with said gadget.

3. Said gadget gets an announced release date well in advance of
   Christmas.

4. My wife tires of hearing me talk about it and suggests I buy
   myself one as an “early Christmas present”.

This is how I ended up with my [2013 Kindle Paperwhite][1], which is
truly a wondrous device for those who enjoy reading books, as an
upgrade to my now-passed-on Kindle Touch. I rate E Ink up there
with the best innovations of the past twenty years. It is infinitely
more comfortable for casual reading than having a backlight blazing
into your eyes, and for darker rooms, the Paperwhite’s front light
complements this awesomely.

And yet, despite all my adoration for Kindle-the-hardware, I can
only recall having spent a total $1 at Amazon to purchase books for
the thing—on [a very short story][2] written by a friend of mine. The
remainder of my reading has been exclusively loans from my local
library via [OverDrive][3], random freebies, and a small handful of
side-loaded titles from other sources, paid and otherwise.

It’s not that I don’t want to read books from Amazon’s fantastic
selection; far from it. The prices are sometimes *really* good. But
I know that whatever books I get from Amazon stay in Amazon. Should
I ever be in the market for a new reader, it would have to be one
of Amazon’s, or my library would become effectively worthless. And,
deep down (way deep down, I suppose; it’s amazing and a little
troubling how a gadget that truly speaks to me can keep me from
thinking clearly about its full impact), I’m a little unsettled by
the fact that a single company is compiling an effectively complete
reading history on me.

This unpleasant situation has arisen by the hand of DRM—[digital
restrictions management][4]. To be perfectly clear on my position on
the matter of DRM, I don’t think it is always intrinsically bad;
its careful application in the context of a good publisher-consumer
balance, such as rentals, unlimited streaming arrangements, or goods
priced so low as to be easily considered disposable, is both fine
and appreciated. But if I’m going to outright buy a book—and there
are several I would have by now—I need to be able to know I can
keep the thing as long as my computers don’t eat the backups, and
reread it whenever I wish. I need to make sure my continued ownership
of my library is not subject to the business plans of external
forces.

I can do this with MP3s (even with Amazon themselves, which I’ve
done on more than a few occasions), which I suspect is due to timing
more than anything else. Market forces pushed the MP3 and a myriad
devices that could handle it to the point that anyone trying to
sell locked music looked foolish. I *am* denied the right to resell
the MP3s that I’ve purchased—at least, as far as the T’s and C’s
are concerned—but, fine, one battle at a time here. I am otherwise
free to shuffle my music around to whatever device I see fit, listen
to it how I wish. That is exactly what I, consumer, desire.

But books—and movies—are a different animal. Publishers of both
have managed to lock up for themselves the role as the technical
gatekeepers because they are utterly convinced that selling bare,
unprotected media means forgoing all profits as nobody past the
first purchaser will pay for the work. Freeloaders are going to get
their piratical access to your works *despite* your efforts, so why
are you punishing your paying customers so? Sorry, but I refuse to
throw money after your goods with such strings attached.

I still love my Kindle-the-hardware. But Kindle-the-publishing-platform
leaves me severely wanting. And I am not sure who, if anyone, on
the publishing side of the equation is willing to change that.
