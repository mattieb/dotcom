When I last re-started my blog using [Felix
Felicis](https://liquidluck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/start.html), I
decided to go ahead and do it (mostly) in the open. This repository
is the result of that effort. Feel free to look around and see how
the sausage is made, but be aware that the content specifically is
copyrighted by me and I give no rights to it.

## Setup

```
pyenv install 3.7.16
poetry env use $HOME/.pyenv/versions/3.7.16/bin/python3.7
poetry shell
pip install liquidluck
poetry install
```
